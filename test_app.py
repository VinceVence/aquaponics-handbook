        Aquaponics is a typical bio-integrated method of production that links the cyclic nature of aquaculture with hydroponics, which shares a sustainable agricultural system [1]. It merges fish cultivation(aquaculture) and plant farming(hydroponics), without the presence of soil at the base of the setup. The mechanism works by combining these two agricultural sciences to sustain the recirculating system by natural biological cycles (nitrification) to supply nitrogen and reduce water inputs together with the non-renewable fertilizers [2]. Several systems, techniques, design, scales and nomenclature within aquaponics have been developed throughout the years and it has already been commercialized and used in many scientific studies [3].

        st.write("""
        Producing plants hydroponically and farming fish using aqua¬¨culture requires special methodologies to make sure that the respective systems are implemented and managed properly [2]. The complexity of each system models is proportional to the parameters being considered and monitored across varying scales and purpose of implementation. Problems may occur when these parameters do not align with the acceptable thresholds that were initially set or external factors like the presence of disease-causing agents for the crops and unwanted chemicals in the waters are seen upon the actual implementation. In the real world, it is very difficult for fish farmers to recommend the perfect fish species for aquaculture in a specific aquaponics system [4]. Land farmers may also be unfamiliar with the merger since growing crops through a land-based system is significantly different compared to an aquaponics environment. Whatever the case may be, investing into the production of an aquaponic system whether home-based or commercialized, is an expensive and risky venture if not equipped with the necessary guides and practices to not just make it work properly, but also sustainably maintaining its mechanisms.

        st.write("""
        Within the emergence of IoT based smart systems and the advancements in Artificial Intelligence, more innovative approaches would be developed to further advance the field of aquaponics and minimize the trade-offs enabling it to become a household or commercial venture. In this new era of science and technology, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are being used and developed for agricultural sciences along with the applications of Machine Learning and automation [5]. There are many applications of AI (Deep Learning and Machine Learning) in the aquaculture and hydroponics field and several journal articles have been published to provide empirical methods and sound practices that are based on gathered data and insights made through data mining [4]‚Äì[8]. Although both these fields share many common intersection with aquaponics, the implementation and scale are relatively different. In a general view, aquaponics encompasses both these fields and merges them to create a feedback and two player system that enables survival of various living agents within the model [9].

        Proper recommendations and guidelines for aquaponic farming are still lacking and requires more research investments focusing on possible production systems (type of fish √ó type of plant √ó densities √ó filtration system √ó hydroponic system √ó aquaculture system) and different varieties of crops [2]. There are studies that integrate Internet of Things (IoT) devices within their aquaponic systems to gather data and make sense about the patterns that occur [10]. This intersection is commonly referred as ‚Äúsmart aquaponics‚Äù where data and information are core elements.  However, measured data are oftentimes affected by complicated environmental factors that are usually nonlinear and various, which increases the complexity and difficulty of maintaining an accurate control system [11]. The massive amount of data in smart aquaponics imposes a variety of challenges, such as multiple sources, data inconsistencies, data volatilities, and structural complexities. To find a way to convert this data into insights and imperatives, various sophisticated Machine Learning(ML) algorithms are being used. For image data, for example, Deep Learning can be utilized because it involves multilevel data representations, from low to high levels, in which high-level features are built on the low-level features and carry rich semantic information that can be used to recognize and detect targets or objects in the image [11]. Deep Learning is commonly used together with other Machine learning models to makes sense of unstructured data like images or text. There are also other Machine Learning algorithms that can be used for structured or tabular datasets that can be utilized for regression or classification problems without the use of sophisticated Deep Learning techniques.  By combining IoT, Data Mining, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, it is possible to create a framework or standard that would aid beginning agriculturists or the common people to implement their own aquaponics system.

The image file paths were then arranged with its corresponding labels through a pandas Data frame to structure the data into two columns(file paths and labels) with the individual images as its rows. The data was then split into three categories namely: training, validation, and testing. Each category has a target size of 224 x 224, color mode is ‚Äòrgb‚Äô, class mode is categorical, and the batch size is 32. The individual images were also preprocessed by scaling them to range from 0 to 1. Random flip, random rotation, random zoom, height adjustment, and width adjustment are some of the data augmentation techniques used. By using data augmentation methods, new sample photos are created from available photos to enhance and prepare the dataset [8]. In this case, only the images from the plant village dataset undergone data augmentation preprocessing. The photos are then used as input to the suggested approach for training the model in the following stage. After undergoing through transfer learning, the data from the base model is then connected to two Dense layers with 256 hidden fully connected(FC) layers and the activation function used was Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). In the fish classification feature, only 128 fully connected layers are used within the two Dense layers.  Both the FC layers are separated by a Dropout function with a value of 0.2 respectively [16]. The dropout function was only applied to the images in the plant village dataset since there is a tendency for the model to overfit in the training data. The newly trained architectural model will be used to anticipate previously unseen images. In this case, the model was evaluated on the test data from the previous split.

The evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and f1-score were utilized to evaluate the model as the hyperparameters are adjusted to determine the best model for the image classification. After the training and evaluation, two classifier weights were eventually achieved. The first model which was trained with the fish images achieved a test accuracy of 99.78% and loss of 0.00722. On the other hand, the second model which was trained with the plant disease images achieved a test accuracy of 96.35% and a loss of 0.11303. Always improving the performance of our models for fish and plant disease classification and analysis is a critical step, but our model achieved a satisfactory performance, which hopefully will support aquaponics practitioners. The major focus of this research is to provide a helper tool that would help non-experts in the field aquaponics to have a guide for data driven decisions about creating and maintaining an aquaponic system. The collection and preparation of genuine datasets and it applications to aquaponics to add more features to the website is a future target.

        - Gardening chores are cut down dramatically or eliminated. The aquaponics grower is able to focus on the enjoyable tasks of feeding the fish and tending to and harvesting the plants.
        - Aquaponic systems can be put anywhere, use them outside, in a greenhouse, in your basement, or in your living room. By using grow-lighting, and space can become a productive garden.
        - Aquaponic systems are scalable. They can fit most sizes and budgets, from small countertop herb systems to backyard gardens, to full-scale farms, aquaponics can do it all.
        - And the best part ‚Äì You get to harvest both plants and fish from your garden.  Truly raise your entire meal in your backyard instead of using dirt or toxic chemical solutions to grow plants, aquaponics uses highly nutritious fish effluent that contains all the required nutrients for optimum plant growth. Instead of discharging water, aquaponics uses the plants, naturally occurring bacteria, and the media in which they grow in to clean and purify the water, after which it is returned to the fish tank. This water can be reused indefinitely and will only need to be topped-off when it is lost through transpiration from the plants and evaporation.
